# Space Invaders Clone

Hey there, I'm trying to develop a game from zero, not using tutorials or any materials that could give me a clue in how to do that. By now the project is divided as the following:

- Add spaceship movements [X]
- Add bullet behavior [X]
- Add Invaders movements [X]
- Add collision detection []
- Add score []
- Add levels []
- Add start screen []
- Add game over screen []
- Add sound []
- Add animations []
